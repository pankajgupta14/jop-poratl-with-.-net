       <p> This digital persona is where you want to lay it all on your audience in the “About Me” section. It can be tricky to produce personal content beyond the basics, so it’s helpful to remember that you’re aiming to sell your experience and skills as they apply to one industry or environment, not necessarily what defines your self-worth as a person.
        <br /> <br />If you’re struggling to communicate your value, ask yourself this question: Why do you do [whatever you do] and what is your impact?
          <br />
          Take the answer and work it into your “About Me” page so potential partners or employers understand what you can do for them and why you’re the person they should hire.</p>
